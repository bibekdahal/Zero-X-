# Zero-X++

A simple (incomplete) compiler building tutorial series. Handles tokenization, parsing, tri-code generation etc.

A more complete but smaller and less optimized compiler (in a single source file) can be found here:

[Zero-X](https://github.com/bibekdahal/Zero-X)

Another of my compiler projects (but still less optmized) can be found here:

[Danphe Compiler](https://github.com/bibekdahal/Danphe-Compiler)


### Features

Zero-X++ supports numerous programming constructs and resembles C/C++ in many ways. Some features include:

- Operator overloading and user-defined operators
- User defined types (structs in C)
- User defined functions
- In-built integer, double, char and boolean types
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Pointers
- etc.

Due to time inconvenience, this project was discontinued and supports only till tri-code generation phase. The assembly code generation and optmization phases are still to be implemented.


## A Tutorial Series

I originally wrote accompanying tutorials along with these code but unfortunately I lost the tutorial documents some time ago.

You can still observe and study the code to learn about compiler design. Each stage of the tutorial is under new commit. You can view commit history to view the complete tutorial-code.
